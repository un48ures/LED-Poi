# LED Poi Project w/ Arduino Uno and Teensy 3.6/4.0
## General
This project is using remote controlled LED Light sticks (so called Pois) to create
a music synchronized, visually appealing light show using the persistence of vision.

Therefore the idea was to have one controll station (PC) which plays the music and also connects to an Arduino Uno which then sends
control commands to the LED Pois to show specific colors.

The original idea came from mortonkopf who used APA102 pixel strips with a Teensy. He built a tube poi which, when rotated quickly, 
made the viewer see real colored images because of the persistence of vision (pov).

So i wanted to take it a step further and make a music synchronized controller which controls 6 or more receiver pois.
Therefore nRF24L01 2.4Ghz Transceiver moduls were used.
